                    Here, I aim to unpack the experience of growing up Chinese in Aotearoa New Zealand, 
                    drawing inspiration from both personal experience and researching the history of those 
                    who came before me.

                    <br>
                    In November 2008, my family arrived in Auckland, New Zealand from Shenzhen, China. 
                    Having spent the first five years of my life in between densely packed high rises, I remember being surprised at how much space there
                    was in between the houses that lined the green suburban roadsides. The contrast in our living
                    conditions and lifestyle were vast, such as my parents having to learn how to mow the lawn for
                    the first time.

                <p class="mono p">
                    <br>Growing up in between two seemingly disparate cultures has shaped my identity in unique ways.
                    This body of work is an attempt to translate memory and history into tangible subject matter,
                    and to rediscover my identity in this diverse and ever-changing narrative.

                        type of gourd that is commonly found in Asian cuisine. 
                        In Chinese, the phrase “吃苦” (chī kǔ, lit."to eat bitter"), is commonly used to
                        denote the endurance of hardship — 
                        I found this phrase particularly fitting for the immigrant experience.</figcaption>

                        abstract shapes, loosely referenced via Google Maps.
                        Alongside the depictions of suburbia from eye level, the maps would also present a
                        different perspective — one that shows the bigger picture.</figcaption>
